# Module 1 - Setting up the environment

ðŸŽ“ **Level**: 100 (Beginner)

âŒ› **Estimated time to complete this lab**: 15 minutes

## Objectives

This module guides you through deployment of the Microsoft Security Copilot solution that will be used in all subsequent modules.

### Prerequisites

To get started with Microsoft Security Copilot and Microsoft Sentinel, you must have a Microsoft Azure subscription with a work/business email. If you do not have a subscription, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en/free).

- An Azure subscription with a work/business email
<!---- Permissions to create a resource group in your Azure subscription--->
- Note: Installing Security Copilot and Sentinel for the very first time in a subscription needs Global Admin permission

Microsoft Security Copilot has an SCU cost ($4 per hour per SCU). This must be configured in order to complete the Beginner and Advnaced hands-on exercises. If any other prompts are executed during the hands-on exercises, you may not be able to complete all the modules.

<!---Microsoft Sentinel provides a "trial mode" where data ingestion up to 10GB/day is free for the first 31 days when first added to a workspace. Sentinel will prompt that it is in trial mode once installed.--->

### Exercise 1: Deploy Security Copilot 

In this exercise, we will show you how to create a brand new Microsoft Security Copilot workspace to store your data. If you already have a pre-existing one that you would like to use, you can skip to Exercise 2.

1. Sign in to Security Copilot (https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com).

2. Set up your security capacity and please fill out the form as follows:
- **Azure Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription where you would like to deploy the Microsoft Security Copilot workspace.
- **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new resource group that will host Security Copilot.
- **Capacity Name**: Please type in "**CopilotForSecurityLab**" but if you would like to create your own name then please keep note for Exercise 2.
- **Prompt evaluation location**: This location will affect where your prompts are evaluated and processed.
- **Allow Global Prompt evaluation**: Leave this box unchecked. This is to ensure data is processed within region.
- **Security compute units**: The number of SCUs needed to process each prompt request.
  - To complete the Beginner and Advanced Modules, it is recommended that you enter 8 SCUs
  <!--- To complete the Beginner, Advanced and Additional Modules, it is recommended that you enter 15 SCUs 
  - If you have already completed the Beginner & Advanced Modules and returning to complete the Additional Modules only, it is recommended that you enter 8 SCUs --->

<!--- ### Exercise 2: Deploy the SCU Timer Logic App 

In this exercise, we will show you how to create a Logic App which will delete the SCU Microsoft Security Copilot resource after 3 hours to ensure that there are no additional charges once the exercises are completed.

If you could not complete the lab previously and are returning to resume, then go to the Logic App and run manually. Please [click here](../Modules/ResumeLab.md) for the steps to manually run the Logic App.

1. Click the "Deploy to Azure" button below.
